# My Cool App

This cool app is build using React with Bootstrap 5.
As a mock server it uses json-server.

## How to run the app

Run "npm run dev" in your terminal (it starts React and the mock server in the same time)

## Note

The json file for the mock server is called data.json and is in the folder called data.
If you want a new data after deleting the items, it's a brand new file in the root directory
(the server must be restarted after adding data from the new file).
